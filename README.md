# YOLOBirdDetect
Welcome to the YOLOBirdDetect repository.

Inside this repository, you'll find three important Python files: Training, Validation, and Testing. Each of these files has its own job, just like their names suggest:

- **Training**: This file is responsible for training our model using a small custom dataset.
- **Validation**: Here, we check how well our model performs on the data it hasn't seen before, making sure it's doing a good job.
- **Testing**: Finally, we put our model to the test, seeing how accurately it can detect birds in new images.

Feel free to explore, contribute, or make any updates to the project. We're always open to new ideas and improvements!
